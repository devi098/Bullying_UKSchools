**Project Topic: How does bullying impact the overall development of children in schools in the UK?**
**Project Category: Data Science**

**Project Description:**
This study examines the impact of bullying on children's overall development in schools in England. This study is based on a detailed scientific study of the effects of bullying on children's academic, social, and emotional development. The major area of study is the categorization of bullying as On-campus, Off-campus, and cyber-bullying. The findings show that bullying has a negative impact on children's academic, social, and emotional well-being. This study also highlights the importance of early detection and prevention of bullying to minimize the impact on children's development with the help of using the appropriate machine learning algorithm. The findings of this study have important implications for teachers, parents, and policymakers in developing strategies to prevent and address bullying in schools and promote positive development for all children.
